<h1 class="special" id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p><strong>hypermediatic</strong> browsers, are browsers which allow hypermedia navigation by treating ALL fileformats (with outbound/embedded links) as first-class citizens by default, rather than getting served through hyperscripted layers like HTML.
A hypermediatic browser <b>MEDIATES</b> in hyperconnecting URIs/URLs, by treating HTML as <strong>JUST</strong> a fileformat, rather then <strong>THE</strong> doorway to hypermedia.</p>

<h1 id="redefining-the-hypermedia-experience">Redefining the hypermedia experience</h1>

<p>Traditionally, hypermedia experiences seem to be explained like this: hypermedia (images/sound/video) is &lsquo;carried&rsquo; by hypertext (HTML):</p>

<p><strong>The carrier is HTML, the modulator is hypermedia.</strong></p>

<p>However, these days, a more appropriate way of looking at things is this:</p>

<p><strong>The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>HTML brought us a lot, but it also is becoming a bottleneck for highperformance hypermedia experiences, pushing developers towards publishing native non-hyperconnected apps into appstores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we want the web to be inclusive for spatial computing and other future formats (gaming e.g.), we must stop looking at it like a web of textdocuments with bells and whistles.</p>

<h1 id="hypermediatic-hypermedia-vs-shallow-webbrowsers">Hypermediatic hypermedia vs shallow webbrowsers</h1>

<p>The following feature-stack timeline has introduced lots of good, but also introduced hyperscripted unhyperified websites, causing trending technologies like <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx.org</a> and native appstores:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hypertext format (HTML)</li>
<li>Embedded Hypermedia in HTML</li>
<li>1995: Javascript in HTML</li>
<li>1999: Browser extensions (store)</li>
</ol>

<p>One could argue that at some point the webbrowser was THE disrupting appstore, by hyperconnecting data itself.<br>
In retrospect, a more hypermediatic browser however, could perhaps be achieved along these lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>support popular fileformats containing outbound/embedded links</li>
<li>filetype extensions (store) to support viewing fileformats with native highperformance</li>
<li>browser extensions (store) only place to allow logic/scripting (javascript e.g.)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>

<ol>
<li>non-HTML fileformats are treated as first-class hypermedia too, fostering latest hardware-to-software hypermedia experiences.</li>
<li>filetype organisations can publish highperformance extensions to the filetype store.</li>
<li>unrecognized fileformats can automatically consult the filetype and/or browser extension-store, and trigger an installation CTA</li>
<li>closing the gap between native highperformance games/spatial computing and the (lower performing security-sandboxed) webbrowser</li>
<li>preventing the security/privacy traps of hyperscripted HTML, by pushing/allowing logic-layer (javascript e.g.) only in browser-extension space</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="criteria-for-a-hypermediatic-browser-or-fileformats">Criteria for a hypermediatic browser or fileformats</h1>

<ol>
<li>fileformats with outbound/embedded links are the focus (not only HTML)</li>
<li>toplevel URLs with an unknown file-extension or mimetype should trigger the fileformat store</li>
<li>Outbound links are supported (like <code>href</code> in HTML)</li>
<li>Embedded links are supported (like <code>src</code> in HTML)</li>
<li>Tagging/Classifying nodes or items is supported (like <code>class</code> in HTML)</li>
<li>Naming nodes or items is supported (like <code>id</code> in HTML, or object names in glTF)</li>
<li>Positioning the user in 2D/3D is supported (like a spawn-point in games, or URI Fragment-jump-to-page-position in HTML)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="native-top-level-url-browsin">Native top-level URL browsin</h2>

<ol>
<li>if an extension or mimetype is unknown</li>
<li>search the fileformat store for supported fileformatviewers (and offer installation)</li>
<li>search the browser extension store for fileformat-related support (and offer installation)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="hypermediatic-as-a-selfmodulating-synthesizer">Hypermediatic as a selfmodulating synthesizer</h1>

<p>Lets take this hypermediatic slogan:</p>

<p><strong>The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)</strong></p>

<p>Why does it say URLs in brackets?<br>
Well the observation is actually that URLs modulate URLs too.<br>
An example is a share-button as a hypermediatic phenomenon: in most cases it shares an URL to another URL.<br>
When the enduser presses the share-button, an URL (usually on the backend) is requesting by sending the shared URL along.<br>
In other words: the URL is the carrier of another URL.<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, thru the lens of McLuhan the following applies: &ldquo;The URL IS the message&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="questioning-the-conservative-interpretation-of-hypermedia">Questioning the conservative interpretation of hypermedia</h1>

<p>Let us focus on the spirit of the following ideas, rather than getting caught up in the forthcoming conflation of &lsquo;hyper&rsquo; terms.<br>
The reframing of hypermedia towards hypermediatic raises several questions that challenge current hypermedia:<br></p>

<ol>
<li>Until which point is HTML holding back highperformant hypermedia-surfing of images/sound/video/3D?</li>
<li>Why are webbrowsers poorly supporting other fileformats using URLs? And does the individual decide which fileformats are (not) deferred to the (browser-extension) backseat?</li>
<li>Why are hypermedia fileformats not encouraged to support the outbound/embedded hyperlink-paradigm like HTML?</li>
<li>Why are operating systems not supporting/encouraging outbound/embedded links in fileformats out of the box? (liquid information/hyperwords e.g.)</li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of it, can perhaps be explained by the <strong>hypertext-first-hypermedia-later vision</strong> which most webbrowsers and operating systems seem to share.<br>
From an historical perspective this makes sense (it was easier to project text than images back in the days).<br>
However, it also means that whatever fileformat is consumed in the webbrowser, gets served through this lens (through HTML) or indirectly via browser extensions.<br></p>
