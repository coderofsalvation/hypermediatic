Abstract

   *hypermediatic* browsers, are browsers which allow hypermedia
   navigation by treating ALL fileformats (with outbound/embedded links)
   as first-class citizens by default, rather than getting served
   through hyperscripted layers like HTML.  A hypermediatic browser
   <b>mediates</b> in hyperconnecting URIs/URLs, by treating HTML as
   *JUST* a fileformat, rather then *THE* doorway to hypermedia.

1.  Redefining the hypermedia experience

   Traditionally, hypermedia experiences seem to be explained like this:
   hypermedia (images/sound/video) is 'carried' by hypertext (HTML):

   *The carrier is HTML, the modulator is hypermedia.*

   However, these days, a more appropriate way of looking at things is
   this:

   *The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)*

   |  HTML brought us a lot, but it also is becoming a bottleneck for
   |  highperformance hypermedia experiences, pushing developers towards
   |  publishing native non-hyperconnected apps into appstores.

   If we want the web to be inclusive for spatial computing and other
   future formats (gaming e.g.), we must stop looking at it like a web
   of textdocuments with bells and whistles.

2.  Hypermediatic hypermedia vs shallow webbrowsers

   The following feature-stack timeline has introduced lots of good, but
   also introduced hyperscripted unhyperified websites, causing trending
   technologies like htmx.org (https://htmx.org) and native appstores:

   1.  Hypertext format (HTML)

   2.  Embedded Hypermedia in HTML
   3.  1995: Javascript in HTML
   4.  1999: Browser extensions (store)

   One could argue that at some point the webbrowser was THE disrupting
   appstore, by hyperconnecting data itself.
   In retrospect, a more hypermediatic browser however, could perhaps be
   achieved along these lines:

   1.  support popular fileformats containing outbound/embedded links
   2.  filetype extensions (store) to support viewing fileformats with
       native highperformance
   3.  browser extensions (store) only place to allow logic/scripting
       (javascript e.g.)

3.  Benefits

   1.  non-HTML fileformats are treated as first-class hypermedia too,
       fostering latest hardware-to-software hypermedia experiences.
   2.  filetype organisations can publish highperformance extensions to
       the filetype store.
   3.  unrecognized fileformats can automatically consult the filetype
       and/or browser extension-store, and trigger an installation CTA
   4.  closing the gap between native highperformance games/spatial
       computing and the (lower performing security-sandboxed)
       webbrowser
   5.  preventing the security/privacy traps of hyperscripted HTML, by
       pushing/allowing logic-layer (javascript e.g.) only in browser-
       extension space

4.  Criteria for a hypermediatic browser or fileformats

   1.  fileformats with outbound/embedded links are the focus (not only
       HTML)
   2.  toplevel URLs with an unknown file-extension or mimetype should
       trigger the fileformat store
   3.  Outbound links are supported (like href in HTML)
   4.  Embedded links are supported (like src in HTML)
   5.  Tagging/Classifying nodes or items is supported (like class in
       HTML)
   6.  Naming nodes or items is supported (like id in HTML, or object
       names in glTF)
   7.  Positioning the user in 2D/3D is supported (like a spawn-point in
       games, or URI Fragment-jump-to-page-position in HTML)

4.1.  Native top-level URL browsin

   1.  if an extension or mimetype is unknown

   2.  search the fileformat store for supported fileformatviewers (and
       offer installation)
   3.  search the browser extension store for fileformat-related support
       (and offer installation)

5.  Hypermediatic as a selfmodulating synthesizer

   Lets take this hypermediatic slogan:

   *The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)*

   Why does it say URLs in brackets?
   Well the observation is actually that URLs modulate URLs too.
   An example is a share-button as a hypermediatic phenomenon: in most
   cases it shares an URL to another URL.
   When the enduser presses the share-button, an URL (usually on the
   backend) is requesting by sending the shared URL along.
   In other words: the URL is the carrier of another URL.

   |  Therefore, thru the lens of McLuhan the following applies: "The
   |  URL IS the message"
