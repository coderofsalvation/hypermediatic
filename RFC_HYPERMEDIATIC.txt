Abstract

   *hypermediatic* browsers, are browsers which allow hypermedia
   navigation by treating ALL fileformats (with outbound/embedded links)
   equally as first-class citizens by default, rather than getting
   served through hyperscripted single-layer like HTML.  A hypermediatic
   browser <b>MEDIATES</b> in hyperconnecting URIs/URLs, by treating
   HTML as *JUST* a fileformat, rather then *THE* doorway to hypermedia.

1.  Redefining the hypermedia experience

   Traditionally, hypermedia experiences seem to be explained like this:
   hypermedia (images/sound/video) is 'carried' by hypertext (HTML):

   *The carrier is HTML, the modulator is hypermedia.*

   However, these days, a more appropriate way of looking at things is
   this:

   *The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)*

   |  HTML brought us a lot, but it also is becoming a bottleneck for
   |  highperformance hypermedia experiences, pushing developers towards
   |  publishing native non-hyperconnected apps into appstores.

   If we want the web to be inclusive for spatial computing and other
   future formats (gaming e.g.), we must stop looking at it like a web
   of textdocuments with bells and whistles.

2.  Criteria for a hypermediatic browser or fileformats

   1.  when possible, convert filenames in documents ('see foo.pdf') to
       navigatable hyperlinks when they exist in the current filesystem/
       directory.

   2.  if online: scan for words containing :// or multiple dots and a
       slash, and present them as navigatable hyperlinks
   3.  (any) fileformats with outbound/embedded links are the focus (not
       only HTML)
   4.  toplevel URLs with an unknown file-extension or mimetype should
       trigger the fileformat store
   5.  Outbound links are supported (like href in HTML, url or file in
       BibTeX)
   6.  Embedded links are supported (like src in HTML)
   7.  Tagging/Classifying nodes or items is supported (like class='foo'
       in HTML, or @foo{} in BibTeX)
   8.  Naming nodes or items is supported (like id in HTML, object names
       in glTF, @foo{myname} in BibTeX)
   9.  Positioning the user in 2D/3D is supported (like a spawn-point in
       games, or URI Fragment-jump-to-page-position in HTML)

   |  Subsets are encouraged too (hypermediatic is a spectrum).  For
   |  example 1 & 2 are nice usecases for terminal/ereaders.

2.1.  Native top-level URL browsin

   1.  if an extension or mimetype is unknown
   2.  search the fileformat store for supported fileformatviewers (and
       offer installation)
   3.  search the browser extension store for fileformat-related support
       (and offer installation)

3.  Hypermediatic hypermedia vs shallow webbrowsers

   The following feature-stack timeline has introduced lots of good, but
   also introduced hyperscripted unhyperified websites, causing trending
   technologies like htmx.org (https://htmx.org) and native appstores:

   1.  Hypertext format (HTML)
   2.  Embedded Hypermedia in HTML
   3.  1995: Javascript in HTML
   4.  1999: Browser extensions (store)

   One could argue that at some point the webbrowser was THE disrupting
   appstore, by hyperconnecting data itself.
   In retrospect, a more hypermediatic browser however, could perhaps be
   achieved along these lines:

   1.  support popular fileformats containing outbound/embedded links
   2.  filetype extensions (store) to support viewing fileformats with
       native highperformance
   3.  browser extensions (store) only place to allow logic/scripting
       (javascript e.g.)

4.  Benefits

   1.  non-HTML fileformats are treated as first-class hypermedia too,
       fostering latest hardware-to-software hypermedia experiences.
   2.  filetype organisations can publish highperformance extensions to
       the filetype store.
   3.  unrecognized fileformats can automatically consult the filetype
       and/or browser extension-store, and trigger an installation CTA
   4.  closing the gap between native highperformance games/spatial
       computing and the (lower performing security-sandboxed)
       webbrowser
   5.  preventing the security/privacy traps of hyperscripted HTML, by
       pushing/allowing logic-layer (javascript e.g.) only in browser-
       extension space

5.  Hypermediatic as a selfmodulating synthesizer

   Lets take this hypermediatic slogan:

   *The carrier IS the URL, the modulators ARE hypermedia (URLs)*

   Why does it say URLs in brackets?
   Well the observation is actually that URLs modulate URLs too.
   An example is a share-button as a hypermediatic phenomenon: in most
   cases it shares an URL to another URL.
   When the enduser presses the share-button, an URL (usually on the
   backend) is requesting by sending the shared URL along.
   In other words: the URL is the carrier of another URL.

   |  Therefore, thru the lens of McLuhan the following applies: "The
   |  URL IS the message"

6.  Questioning the conservative interpretation of hypermedia

   Let us focus on the spirit of the following ideas, rather than
   getting caught up in the forthcoming conflation of 'hyper' terms.
   The reframing of hypermedia towards hypermediatic raises several
   questions that challenge current hypermedia:

   1.  Until which point is HTML holding back highperformant hypermedia-
       surfing of images/sound/video/3D?
   2.  Why are webbrowsers poorly supporting other fileformats using
       URLs?  And does the individual decide which fileformats are (not)
       deferred to the (browser-extension) backseat?
   3.  Why are hypermedia fileformats not encouraged to support the
       outbound/embedded hyperlink-paradigm like HTML?

   4.  Why are operating systems not supporting/encouraging outbound/
       embedded links in fileformats out of the box? (liquid
       information/hyperwords e.g.)

   A lot of it, can perhaps be explained by the *hypertext-first-
   hypermedia-later vision* which most webbrowsers and operating systems
   seem to share.
   From an historical perspective this makes sense (it was easier to
   project text than images back in the days).
   However, it also means that whatever fileformat is consumed in the
   webbrowser, gets served through this lens (through HTML) or
   indirectly via browser extensions.
